### Description
A day spent working towards future career goals.

### Self-Assessment
I generally feel as though I could use a JavaScript refresher. I'd also like to spend some more time with Angular and TypeScript.

I'd like to meet more people in the industry and speak to them about their positions. I don't have a specific idea of what I'd like to do after school. I know that I'm looking for an office that is a nice culture fit. I would also like the ability to work part time from home.
