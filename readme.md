#### _Epicodus Code Review_
UI Week 4: Self-Improvement

### Description
A day spent working towards future career goals.

### Self-Assessment
I generally feel as though I could use a one week refresher course on JavaScript more than I could use job search and interview prep. I would feel more comfortable relearning past lessons than participating in group week. Hammering in skills that I was only decent at before would be nice, white-boarding at this point would probably be me staring at a blank board.

This isn't the first time I've changed careers. I'm fairly certain that I'll be able to pick up any required skills along the way. Having an idea of what I would like to focus on or where I would like to work after getting out of school could help, otherwise, I feel fine.

I would apply for any job because I know it's a numbers game. I'm excited to be under-qualified and have to prove myself because I've been over-qualified for so long and have had to dumb myself down for interviews or available jobs. This will be refreshing.

Being around nervous people is probably the worst bit of it. Some folks seem nervous or falsely confident. Being around that type of energy has always been extremely difficult for me.

### Work
- set up git repository
- create project folder
- add readme and begin filling in
- add self-assessment to readme
- add plan to readme
- add work to readme

### Plan
- I would love to have a mentor so I could get one on one lessons and questions answered. This would be even better if I could go see this person during class hours when assignments are lagging and folks start slacking and changing the energy.
- I already do self-study on the side, so it's just a matter of picking and choosing what is more important. Learning something new or going back to JavaScript.
- I like finding jobs through connections. I would rather get my lessons accomplished in school and spend the evenings networking.
- I'm a job coach already, so while I believe everyone can use a little help sometimes, I don't think I require extra attention in the job search arena.
